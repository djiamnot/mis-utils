=========

Some of these scripts may be usefull for various tasks. If they are here, it's probably because I needed this kind of
functionnality more than once:

gst-capture2videoloopback.sh
---------------------------- 
read camera and dump the stream into a video loopback device (requires videoloopback kernel module)

gst-videofile2videoloopback.sh
------------------------------
As above but redirect a video file to loopback device

stitcher.sh
-----------
Use ffmpeg to stitch videos, overlay text etc.
